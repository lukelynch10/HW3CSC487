## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## function for min max normalization

foo <- function(a,min_new, max_new){
  return ((a - min(a) / (max(a) - min(a)) * (max_new - min_new) + min_new)
}
